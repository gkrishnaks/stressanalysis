/*  EXPERIMENTAL STRESS ANALYSIS 

This program was developed for an academic project for Experimental stress analysis using Strain gauges, Arduino Uno and with Data logging. Please refer to the arduino_program in the same repository on how the Arduino program works.

The program "handshakes" with the Arduino this way. Arduino sends A continously until it gets a response from this program. When Arduino gets a response from this program, Arduino sends over data in this format: vref<comma>gaugeoutput1<comma>gaugeoutput2<comma>gaugeoutput3<carriagereturn> and Processing reads it into a string until the carriage return ("\n"). Then it splits the string at comma ',' and stores individual values in float array for further computations. Once the scientific computations are complete, the program writes the results to a timestamped log file in comma separated value format .csv file.

Terminology used in this program:
1) First letter of variable name is in lowercase, second word in variable name has first letter capitalised. Underscore symbol and numbers in identifier is avoided in the entire program.
2) It is known that an array's first element is element[0], but for better readability, In an array, 1st item of consideration is stored in 2nd element of arrays which is element[1]. 
   Therefore strain[1] means first strain, not the second. strain[0] is set to have 0 and is ignored in calculations.

Data log filename : "Log dd\mm\yyyy : hh:00 - (hh+1):00.csv" in the same directory of Processing. 
Example : "Log 14\03\2014 : 16:00 - 17.00.csv" 
The file has individual rows timestamped at the first entry. The first row of the file has column headings.
 
If filename doesn't exist, file is created. Else, it is opened and appended. Since Processing has no "true" append mode for files, it has to be opened, written and closed every iteration. This data .csv log file can then be opened in a program like Live-graph (www.live-graph.org) for plotting real time dynamic graph between various  variables from data file, or it can be opened in Scientific computational softwares or Spreadsheet applications in Office suites like LibreOffice Calc or Gnumeric for post-processing.  

The circuit diagram and also the documentation on engineering topics and explanation on selection of formulae and expressions will be added to the repository at a later date.
